This is a simple starter full stack MERN app I did to learn the basics of MongoAtlas, Express, React, Redux and React-Router. I followed [Rishi Prasad's guide](https://blog.bitsrc.io/build-a-login-auth-app-with-mern-stack-part-1-c405048e3669) to set everything up. The frontend was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run client-install`

Runs `npm install` on the frontend to install frontend dependencies.

### `npm start`

Starts the backend Express server.

### `npm run server`

Starts the backend Express server using `nodemon`

### `npm run server`

Runs `npm start` on create-react-app frontend.

### `npm run dev`

Concurrently runs both server and client.
